- I didn't manage to build a bootable image with only an EXT4 partition without
  using a root account and mounting the image.
- The only way to install a bootloader without root and mount was to use
  syslinux on a FAT16 parition.
- I don't know if nixos-switch can work with a separate boot partition.
